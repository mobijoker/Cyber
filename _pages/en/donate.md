If you appreciate something I made, you can use PayPal to buy me a coffee!

I spend a lot of time trying to make sure that the themes, plugins and another thing I build are useful and easy to use, and the ultimate proof of that for me is that you actually want to use them.

I’m a freelance developer, without a regular income, so every little contribution helps cover my costs and lets me spend more time building things for people like you to enjoy.
