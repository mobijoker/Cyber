After purchasing a new Mac, we have to think about migrating projects of sites from iWeb from the old Mac to a new one. Everything, as always, simple.


Projects developed in the iWeb are stored in a package named `Domain.sites2` and located in `~/Library/Application Support/iWeb/`

In order to migrate all projects to the other Mac, you need to move this package at the same place to a new Mac. Projects will be automatically appear in iWeb.

Also you can put the package to a portable drive and open it in the iWeb from this drive. For this go to: `File` -&gt; `Open With` -&gt; `iWeb`.
