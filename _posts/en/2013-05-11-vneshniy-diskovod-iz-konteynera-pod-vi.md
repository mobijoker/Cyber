Turn already unnecessary container under the hdd or external drive into an external optical disk drive.

Lately I more often work on the NetBook and, as every knows, in them is no  optical drive. But, sometimes is necessary to use some optical disk. For example, when I need to install a driver for some device, and it is only on a optical disk. Then need to read information from optical disk on another computer with a optical drive, record on a USB flash drive and then use it on a NetBook. I could buy an external optical disc drive but they are not cheap. And I, probably like many, have many different devices that is not used.

I found an old container for external hard drives "ST Lab 3.5 Hard Drive Enclosure":

and optical disk drive "Sony NEC Optiarc AD-7170A":

You can use IDE or SATA devices, most importantly that the controller and the drive have the same interface.


**Step 1.** Disassembly external drive (in my case, the external container for HDD). Case we no longer need. We only need the controller and power supply.

**Step 2.** Connect the controller to the optical drive via standard wires. The controller does not matter that it is connected to HDD or optical drive.

**Step 3.** The only thing left to construct a new case for the external optical drive and it's ready! Everyone makes the case from those materials that he has. I did not make the case, as I will not use them often.
