An easy to use WordPress plugin that replaces the default Theme and Plugin Source Code Editor with an enhanced editor by a [CodeMirror library](https://codemirror.net/).

<br><br>

### Description

<img src="/images/syntax-highlighter-for-wp-editor/banner.png" alt="WP Plugin &quot;Syntax Highlighter for WP Editor&quot;" />

This is where the "Syntax Highlighter for WP Editor" can help. With an enhanced source code editor you can see a code with syntax highlighting, and with line numbering, so you can easily read your code and detect any errors.

This plugin give you finer control over editor, it can be configured on the plugin settings page. You can chose from 36 different color themes for your editor.
