Today I upgraded the Subversion on my computer from 1.6 to 1.7 version. Subversion version 1.7 has a new repository structure and requires to upgrade all existing working copies.


If we attempt to use Subversion 1.7 on a working copy created with an older version of Subversion, then we will see the following error:

```
svn status
```

<pre>
svn: E155036: Please see the 'svn upgrade' command
svn: E155036: Working copy '/home/user/project' is too old (format 10, created by Subversion 1.6)
</pre>

We need to use the `svn upgrade` command to upgrade the working copy to the most recent metadata format supported by the new version of Subversion.

```
svn upgrade [PATH TO PROJECT]
```

<pre>
Upgraded '.'
Upgraded 'A'
Upgraded 'A/B'
Upgraded 'A/B/E'
</pre>

Now my working copy is upgraded!

**Note:** The `svn upgrade` command need to do for every SVN working copy.

**Note:** After upgrading to Subversion 1.7, you cannot go back to Subversion 1.6. And upgraded working copies will be unusable by older versions of Subversion.

**Note:** The `svn upgrade` command may take a while, and for some users, it may be more practical to simply checkout a new working copy.
