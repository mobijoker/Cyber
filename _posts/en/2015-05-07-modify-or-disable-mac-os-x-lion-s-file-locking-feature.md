Whenever you try to modify a file that you have not touched in over two weeks, you’ll receive the following message:
<pre>
The file [File Name] is locked because you haven’t made any changes to it recently.
</pre>

This happens because the files which have not been changed for 2 weeks (by default) are automatically locked by OS X Lion. This is to prevent accidental auto-save changes from modifying your files.

To modify or disable file locking feature in Mac OS Lion follow the steps.

**Step 1**
Open the System Preferences from the Apple menu on the top left.

**Step 2**
Select "Time Machine".

**Step 3**
Click the "Options" button.

**Step 4**

*a)* To disable file locking feature, uncheck the box next to "Lock documents [2 weeks] after last edit".

*b)* To change the time interval between file locking, click the drop-down list and choose 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month or 1 year.

Then click "Save" button.

Now you wouldn’t get the annoying prompt.
