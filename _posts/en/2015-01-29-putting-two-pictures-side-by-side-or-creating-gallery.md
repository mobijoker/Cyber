When you have many images that you want to include in a blog post, it is important to place them compactly. This way, the reader won’t have to scroll down forever and ever to see your images. Here’s a simple solution to do that.


All you need is a table. In a table you can place multiple images on the grid. You can use two, three or more columns.

**Step 1:** Insert the table code to place where you need to put two pictures on the same line.

```
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Photo 1</td>
<td>Photo 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
```

Or if you have more then two images then, repeat part of the table code like following:

```
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Photo 1.1</td>
<td>Photo 1.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Photo 2.1</td>
<td>Photo 2.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Photo 3.1</td>
<td>Photo 3.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
```

**Step 2:** Insert your images into boxes instead of text “Photo 1” and “Photo 2” etc.

Example:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Photo 1.1</td>
<td>Photo 1.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Photo 2.1</td>
<td>Photo 2.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Photo 3.1</td>
<td>Photo 3.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**P.S.**
This solution is works in Blogger, WordPress and other CMS.
