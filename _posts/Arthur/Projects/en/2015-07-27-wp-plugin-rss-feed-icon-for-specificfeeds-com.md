The plugin is based on the service [SpecificFeeds.com](http://www.specificfeeds.com). SpecificFeeds allows your visitors to receive messages from your Blog/RSS Feed by email.

To use, enter your personal link from SpecificFeeds.com, choose icon and click "Save Changes". Then you can put shortcode [specificfeeds-icon] in needed place. It's that simple! If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.
