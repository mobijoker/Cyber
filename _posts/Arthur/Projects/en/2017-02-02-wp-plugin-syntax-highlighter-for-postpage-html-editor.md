An easy to use WordPress plugin that replaces the default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor with an enhanced editor by a [CodeMirror library](https://codemirror.net/). The WordPress default Post & Page HTML/Text Editor is great for doing some custom changes to HTML markup of your post/page, although it is rather limited. This is where the "Syntax Highlighter for Post/Page HTML Editor" can help. With an enhanced HTML/Text editor you can see a code with syntax highlighting, and with line numbering, so you can easily read your HTML markup and detect any errors.
