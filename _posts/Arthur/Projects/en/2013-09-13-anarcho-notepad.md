![WP Theme Anarcho Notepad](/images/projects/anarcho-notepad/preview.png)
Inspired by the idea of anarchy, I designed this free premium WordPress theme for your personal blogs and diaries. This theme is perfect for writers and artists. "Anarcho Notepad" can be easily customised and already translated to different languages. It utilises latest HTML-5, CSS-3, PHP and WordPress native functions for creating the awesomeness that looks good on every browser. I’m constantly adding new features to this theme to allow you to personalise it to your own needs. If you want a new feature or just want to be able to change something just ask me and I would be happy to add it. I'm glad to present you the most anarchist WP-theme Of All! Enjoy!

>This theme is used simultaneously by more than 3.000 people worldwide!

### Child Theme

A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes allow you to modify, or add to the functionality of that parent theme. A child theme is the best, safest, and easiest way to modify an existing theme, whether you want to make a few tiny changes or extensive changes. Instead of modifying the theme files directly, you can create a child theme and override within.

Why use a Child Theme? Here are a few reasons:

* If you modify an existing theme and it is updated, your changes will be lost. With a child theme, you can update the parent theme (which might be important for security or functionality) and still keep your changes.
* It can speed up development time.
* It’s a great way to get started if you are just learning WordPress theme development.
