An easy to use WordPress plugin that replaces the default Theme and Plugin Source Code Editor with an enhanced editor by a [CodeMirror library](https://codemirror.net/).

<br><br>

### Description

<img src="/images/syntax-highlighter-for-wp-editor/banner.png" alt="WP Plugin &quot;Syntax Highlighter for WP Editor&quot;" />
